## Additonal Skills and Frameworks

### GSAP - GreenSock Animation Platform

I made use of the gsap library to add animations to various elements on the page for a more engaging user experience.

### ASCII React Component

Implemented an early version of a React component that I am currently working on that uses the Figlet library in combination with a text color fader script 
by http://patorjk.com to easily create impressive ASCII art for a retro feel.
